============================

Multideminsional C++11-arrays using template meta-programming

USAGE
-----

This is a header-only C++11-library.

Simply `#include multidimensional/array.hpp` and you're good to go.

REFERENCE
---------

For now, see `test_array_minimal.cpp` for the API (it's dead simple anyway)...

REQUIREMENTS
------------

* The tests require `boost_unit_test_framework`.
* The build system requires `rake`

TESTS
-----

Run `rake` or `rake test` to run the tests.
The required boost libraries will auto(magic)ally be searched for.
